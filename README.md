# I did a remake of my Macos machine!!!!! 
New cursors, new tiling system, new wallpaper, 
new menubar, browser upgrade, set up neovim, learned neovim, set up a terminal multiplexer, and set up a beatiful translucent terminal config.
You have no idea how happy I am.

Side note: I could not export my chrome settings, but I basically followed the tabliss section of [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=lhPpRl2xlWc). 
The picture I used is hosted on unsplash [here](https://unsplash.com/photos/people-walking-on-street-during-nighttime-7iFyVYpgkf8). Also, I added a little custom css for 5vh top-padding
on the topSegment class.
